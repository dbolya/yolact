A simple, fully convolutional model for real-time instance segmentation. This is the code for our papers:
 - [YOLACT: Real-time Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02689)
 - [YOLACT++: Better Real-time Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06218)

#### YOLACT++ (v1.2) released! ([Changelog](CHANGELOG.md))
YOLACT++'s resnet50 model runs at 33.5 fps on a Titan Xp and achieves 34.1 mAP on COCO's `test-dev` (check out our journal paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06218)).

In order to use YOLACT++, make sure you compile the DCNv2 code. (See [Installation](https://github.com/dbolya/yolact#installation))

To evalute the model, put the corresponding weights file in the `./weights` directory and run one of the following commands. The name of each config is everything before the numbers in the file name (e.g., `yolact_base` for `yolact_base_54_800000.pth`).
## Quantitative Results on COCO
```Shell
# Quantitatively evaluate a trained model on the entire validation set. Make sure you have COCO downloaded as above.
# This should get 29.92 validation mask mAP last time I checked.
python eval.py --trained_model=weights/yolact_base_54_800000.pth

# Output a COCOEval json to submit to the website or to use the run_coco_eval.py script.
# This command will create './results/bbox_detections.json' and './results/mask_detections.json' for detection and instance segmentation respectively.
python eval.py --trained_model=weights/yolact_base_54_800000.pth --output_coco_json

# You can run COCOEval on the files created in the previous command. The performance should match my implementation in eval.py.
python run_coco_eval.py

# To output a coco json file for test-dev, make sure you have test-dev downloaded from above and go
python eval.py --trained_model=weights/yolact_base_54_800000.pth --output_coco_json --dataset=coco2017_testdev_dataset
```
## Qualitative Results on COCO
```Shell
# Display qualitative results on COCO. From here on I'll use a confidence threshold of 0.15.
python eval.py --trained_model=weights/yolact_base_54_800000.pth --score_threshold=0.15 --top_k=15 --display
```
## Benchmarking on COCO
```Shell
# Run just the raw model on the first 1k images of the validation set
python eval.py --trained_model=weights/yolact_base_54_800000.pth --benchmark --max_images=1000
```
## Images
```Shell
# Display qualitative results on the specified image.
python eval.py --trained_model=weights/yolact_base_54_800000.pth --score_threshold=0.15 --top_k=15 --image=my_image.png

# Process an image and save it to another file.
python eval.py --trained_model=weights/yolact_base_54_800000.pth --score_threshold=0.15 --top_k=15 --image=input_image.png:output_image.png

# Process a whole folder of images.
python eval.py --trained_model=weights/yolact_base_54_800000.pth --score_threshold=0.15 --top_k=15 --images=path/to/input/folder:path/to/output/folder
```
## Video
```Shell
# Display a video in real-time. "--video_multiframe" will process that many frames at once for improved performance.
# If you want, use "--display_fps" to draw the FPS directly on the frame.
python eval.py --trained_model=weights/yolact_base_54_800000.pth --score_threshold=0.15 --top_k=15 --video_multiframe=4 --video=my_video.mp4

# Display a webcam feed in real-time. If you have multiple webcams pass the index of the webcam you want instead of 0.
python eval.py --trained_model=weights/yolact_base_54_800000.pth --score_threshold=0.15 --top_k=15 --video_multiframe=4 --video=0

# Process a video and save it to another file. This uses the same pipeline as the ones above now, so it's fast!
python eval.py --trained_model=weights/yolact_base_54_800000.pth --score_threshold=0.15 --top_k=15 --video_multiframe=4 --video=input_video.mp4:output_video.mp4
```
As you can tell, `eval.py` can do a ton of stuff. Run the `--help` command to see everything it can do.
```Shell
python eval.py --help
```


# Training
By default, we train on COCO. Make sure to download the entire dataset using the commands above.
 - To train, grab an imagenet-pretrained model and put it in `./weights`.
   - For Resnet101, download `resnet101_reducedfc.pth` from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tvqFPd4bJtakOlmn-uIA492g2qurRChj/view?usp=sharing).
   - For Resnet50, download `resnet50-19c8e357.pth` from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jy3yCdbatgXa5YYIdTCRrSV0S9V5g1rn/view?usp=sharing).
   - For Darknet53, download `darknet53.pth` from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Y431j4sagFpSReuPNoFcj9h7azDTZFf/view?usp=sharing).
 - Run one of the training commands below.
   - Note that you can press ctrl+c while training and it will save an `*_interrupt.pth` file at the current iteration.
   - All weights are saved in the `./weights` directory by default with the file name `<config>_<epoch>_<iter>.pth`.
```Shell
# Trains using the base config with a batch size of 8 (the default).
python train.py --config=yolact_base_config

# Trains yolact_base_config with a batch_size of 5. For the 550px models, 1 batch takes up around 1.5 gigs of VRAM, so specify accordingly.
python train.py --config=yolact_base_config --batch_size=5

# Resume training yolact_base with a specific weight file and start from the iteration specified in the weight file's name.
python train.py --config=yolact_base_config --resume=weights/yolact_base_10_32100.pth --start_iter=-1

# Use the help option to see a description of all available command line arguments
python train.py --help
```

## Multi-GPU Support
YOLACT now supports multiple GPUs seamlessly during training:

 - Before running any of the scripts, run: `export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=[gpus]`
   - Where you should replace [gpus] with a comma separated list of the index of each GPU you want to use (e.g., 0,1,2,3).
   - You should still do this if only using 1 GPU.
   - You can check the indices of your GPUs with `nvidia-smi`.
 - Then, simply set the batch size to `8*num_gpus` with the training commands above. The training script will automatically scale the hyperparameters to the right values.
   - If you have memory to spare you can increase the batch size further, but keep it a multiple of the number of GPUs you're using.
   - If you want to allocate the images per GPU specific for different GPUs, you can use `--batch_alloc=[alloc]` where [alloc] is a comma seprated list containing the number of images on each GPU. This must sum to `batch_size`.

## Logging
YOLACT now logs training and validation information by default. You can disable this with `--no_log`. A guide on how to visualize these logs is coming soon, but now you can look at `LogVizualizer` in `utils/logger.py` for help.

## Pascal SBD
We also include a config for training on Pascal SBD annotations (for rapid experimentation or comparing with other methods). To train on Pascal SBD, proceed with the following steps:
 1. Download the dataset from [here](http://home.bharathh.info/pubs/codes/SBD/download.html). It's the first link in the top "Overview" section (and the file is called `benchmark.tgz`).
 2. Extract the dataset somewhere. In the dataset there should be a folder called `dataset/img`. Create the directory `./data/sbd` (where `.` is YOLACT's root) and copy `dataset/img` to `./data/sbd/img`.
 4. Download the COCO-style annotations from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ExrRSPVctHW8Nxrn0SofU1lVhK5Wn0_S).
 5. Extract the annotations into `./data/sbd/`.
 6. Now you can train using `--config=yolact_resnet50_pascal_config`. Check that config to see how to extend it to other models.

I will automate this all with a script soon, don't worry. Also, if you want the script I used to convert the annotations, I put it in `./scripts/convert_sbd.py`, but you'll have to check how it works to be able to use it because I don't actually remember at this point.

If you want to verify our results, you can download our `yolact_resnet50_pascal_config` weights from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yLVwtkRtNxyl0kxeMCtPXJsXFFyc_FHe). This model should get 72.3 mask AP_50 and 56.2 mask AP_70. Note that the "all" AP isn't the same as the "vol" AP reported in others papers for pascal (they use an averages of the thresholds from `0.1 - 0.9` in increments of `0.1` instead of what COCO uses).

## Custom Datasets
You can also train on your own dataset by following these steps:
 - Create a COCO-style Object Detection JSON annotation file for your dataset. The specification for this can be found [here](http://cocodataset.org/#format-data). Note that we don't use some fields, so the following may be omitted:
   - `info`
   - `liscense`
   - Under `image`: `license, flickr_url, coco_url, date_captured`
   - `categories` (we use our own format for categories, see below)
 - Create a definition for your dataset under `dataset_base` in `data/config.py` (see the comments in `dataset_base` for an explanation of each field):
```Python
my_custom_dataset = dataset_base.copy({
    'name': 'My Dataset',

    'train_images': 'path_to_training_images',
    'train_info':   'path_to_training_annotation',

    'valid_images': 'path_to_validation_images',
    'valid_info':   'path_to_validation_annotation',

    'has_gt': True,
    'class_names': ('my_class_id_1', 'my_class_id_2', 'my_class_id_3', ...)
})
```
 - A couple things to note:
   - Class IDs in the annotation file should start at 1 and increase sequentially on the order of `class_names`. If this isn't the case for your annotation file (like in COCO), see the field `label_map` in `dataset_base`.
   - If you do not want to create a validation split, use the same image path and annotations file for validation. By default (see `python train.py --help`), `train.py` will output validation mAP for the first 5000 images in the dataset every 2 epochs.
 - Finally, in `yolact_base_config` in the same file, change the value for `'dataset'` to `'my_custom_dataset'` or whatever you named the config object above. Then you can use any of the training commands in the previous section.

#### Creating a Custom Dataset from Scratch
See [this nice post by @Amit12690](https://github.com/dbolya/yolact/issues/70#issuecomment-504283008) for tips on how to annotate a custom dataset and prepare it for use with YOLACT.
